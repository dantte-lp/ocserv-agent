```

Or manually:
```bash
gh api --method POST \
  /repos/dantte-lp/ocserv-agent/actions/runners/registration-token \
  --jq '.token'
```

### 2. Start Runner

```bash
RUNNER_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" make runner-up
```

### 3. Check Status

```bash
make runner-logs
```

### 4. Stop Runner

```bash
make runner-down
```

## Makefile Targets

Add to main Makefile:

```makefile
# GitHub Actions Runner
.PHONY: runner-up runner-down runner-logs runner-token

runner-token:
	@gh api --method POST /repos/dantte-lp/ocserv-agent/actions/runners/registration-token --jq '.token'

runner-up:
	@echo "üèÉ Starting GitHub Actions runner..."
	cd deploy/compose && podman-compose -f github-runner.yml up -d
	@echo "‚úÖ Runner started. Check logs: make runner-logs"

runner-down:
	@echo "üõë Stopping GitHub Actions runner..."
	cd deploy/compose && podman-compose -f github-runner.yml down

runner-logs:
	@podman logs -f ocserv-agent-github-runner
```

## Workflow Configuration

Update workflows to use self-hosted runner:

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    # Or specific labels:
    # runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, x64, podman]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Runner not appearing in GitHub

1. Check logs: `podman logs ocserv-agent-github-runner`
2. Verify token is valid (expires after 1 hour)
3. Get new token and restart

### Runner stuck

```bash
podman-compose -f github-runner.yml down
podman-compose -f github-runner.yml up -d
```

### Clean restart

```bash
podman-compose -f github-runner.yml down -v  # Remove volumes
podman-compose -f github-runner.yml up -d
```

## Security Notes

- Runner has sudo access (for package installation)
- Runs in isolated container
- `/workspace` mounted read-write for builds
- No Docker socket mounted by default (add if needed)
